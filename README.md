# AHB-APB Bridge

Modern embedded systems often involve the integration of diverse peripherals and components, each with its own communication standard. The Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) and Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) are two widely used interconnect protocols in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. The AHB-APB Bridge serves as a crucial link between these buses, enabling seamless and efficient communication between high-performance cores and peripheral modules within an integrated circuit.

## Introduction

The AHB-APB Bridge, featured in this repository, addresses the necessity for interoperability between the AHB, designed for high-speed data transfers between on-chip modules, and the APB, optimized for connecting lower bandwidth peripherals. This bridge plays a pivotal role in the system architecture, acting as a mediator that ensures the smooth exchange of data between the high-performance core modules connected via AHB and the diverse set of peripheral devices connected through APB.

In essence, the AHB-APB Bridge acts as a translator, facilitating communication between components with disparate data transfer rates and protocols. This becomes especially crucial in complex SoC designs where a mix of high-speed processing cores and slower peripheral devices coexist.

## Features

- **AHB to APB Bridging Functionality:** The core functionality of the bridge lies in its ability to seamlessly translate transactions between the AHB and APB buses, allowing for effective communication between high-performance cores and peripheral modules.

- **Configurable Parameters for Flexibility:** The bridge provides configurable parameters, offering flexibility to tailor its behavior to the specific requirements of different embedded systems.

- **Verilog Source Code:** The bridge is implemented in Verilog, making it highly adaptable and easy to integrate into various hardware projects.
